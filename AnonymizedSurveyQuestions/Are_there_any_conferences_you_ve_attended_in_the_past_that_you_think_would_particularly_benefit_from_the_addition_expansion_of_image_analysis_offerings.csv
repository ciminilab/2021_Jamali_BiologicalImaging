 Microscopy Society of Northeastern Ohio Spring Meeting
.
A one-day addition to some of the small conferences would be great. The big conferences like ASCB get too bogged down in so many events and I think a smaller forum is better for learning this sort of hands-on material.
A workshop or other hands-on demonstration on image analysis would fit in with ASCB.

"ACMM26 had some good image analysis, but there is always room for more!"

ASCB (if they don't already have a workshop). So many people go to that conference in the cell biology field.
"ASCB / CellBio, Biophysical Society meeting"
ASCB / SFN
ASCB 2018
"ASCB, which I note already has a lot on this."
ASCB--has imaging sessions but would be great to have image analysis specific sessions
ASCB.   MBL 
ASCB/EMBO
ASCB/EMBO; 
All Microscopy meetings should include IA in one way or another.
"All have such offerings, except maybe Biophysical Society"
"All of them! (ASCB, Biophy, M&M, etc)"
All of them! I have never been to a conference that offered this
"American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB), Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF)"
"Annual meeting of Society for Neuroscience, FENS Forum"
Any conference on hyperspectral imaging
"Any microbiology meeting - actually, pretty much any biology meeting."
Ascb and biophysical society
Australasian Neuroscience Society
BMES
"BPS used to be great, but has taken a downward.turn recently"
BSCB ASCB
Biophysical Society Annual Meeting
Biophysical Society Annual Meeting
"Biophysical Society Annual Meeting, American Society for Cell Biology"
Biophysical Society Meetings
Biophysical society meeting
"C. elegans meetings, Soc. for Developmental Biology meetings, ASCB"
"Cell biology meetings are quite good at this, but I've found that the developmental biology community, despite using some advances microscopy tools, are far behind in quantitative image analysis, so that community could benefit."
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Meetings/Conferences
Cold spring harbor stem cell meeting
DPA: Pathology Visions
Did not attend any
Difficult because everyone is at different levels
Don't know
EB
ELMI
ELMI
ELMI - lots of facility staff attend
"ELMI, Trends in Microscopy"
EMBL seeing is believing
Elmi
European Congress of Pathology
"Every single one I've ever attended. Personally would love to see something like this at ARVO (and similar), in addition than the sponsored booths."
FOM

Focus on Microscopy (FOM)
"From Images to Knowledge with ImageJ & Friends, EMBL Heidelberg, Germany (6 - 8 Dec 2018). It was a great opportunity to interact with the bioimage analysis ecosystem. Unfortunately, I havn't had the opportunity to attend any NEUBIAS Conference"
Gordon Cell motility
Histochemical society meetings 
"Holly's AIM workshop, FOM, CYTO"
I have not
I think a lot of topical conferences that have imaging component - it should be matched by image analysis - thinking about Immunology (AAI)
I think all kinds of Imaging Conferences could profit from it
I would like online and free access
"I've only attended cytodata, but I'm sure there are many others that are more relevant."
ISSCR
Image analysis sessions at microscopy conferences are understandably cutting-edge and can be hard to access for those outside the computational science sphere. Expanding this offering with short workshops to help less experienced scientists access the advances would be very valuable in my opinion.
International Worm Meeting
Keystones

MMC
MMC
"MMC (a UK, RMS-sponsored event)"
"MMC (and other 'microscopy meetings) does a good job of having these additional workshops, they could be expanded, and perhaps more should be offered to the 'cell biology' community (and cell biology meetings)"
"MMC, ELMI"
Maybe ASCB (CellBio)
Maybe ASCB.l although they do offer many sessions already. 
Maybe the Biophysical Society meeting conference (BPS)?
Microscopy & Microanalysis (M&M); Neuroscience (SFN); American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) annual meeting; AACR
Microscopy & Microanalysis Meeting
"Microscopy & Microanalysis, AACR, Neuroscience."
Microscopy and Microanalysis could do way more than it currently does
"Microscopy courses @ MBL, Society for Neuroscience"
Most cell biology conferences would benefit. But I would say the time allocation would greatly vary from conference to conference.
"Most of the really big conferences such as ASCB, Neuro, CYTO"

The ISBI conference was fantastic to be introduced to a new area  https://biomedicalimaging.org/2019/
There are already conferences dedicated to image analysis.
This multiplex event https://biotrac.com/immune_oncology/ is postponed to Spring 2021 - I encourage you to interact with Mark Nardone of BioTrac to 'talk about your stuff' there.
"With COVID the future of tradeshows is unceartain, but a branch off of CellBio or Neuroscoence which targets training or an ""image processing challenge"" would be awesome ."
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes from Nikon imaging centre 
"Yes, Advanced Imaging Methods in Berkley"
"Yes, confereces I've attented almost never include a section for image analysis"
"Yes, there are three. NEUBIAS, Robert Hasse Yoube Channel and Python for microscopist by sreeni"
Yes.
Yes. 
Yes. Society for Neuroscience or AACR. Hands-on image analysis classes using free software (there are plenty of commercialized software which are not easily accessible)
"attended ELMI but maybe that is too large to offer a suitably ""personalised"" training in analysis?"
cell profiler workshop
most of them...seriously 
no
no
no
no
no
not applicable
"not really, I think people know they're important aspects of our science and will go to conferences more geared towards that if they're comfortable working with the tools, otherwise they outsource"
not sure; maybe EMBLSeeing is Believing; start combo imaging and analysis workshop?; or have before or after another mtg like ASCB
society for neuroscience
yes
