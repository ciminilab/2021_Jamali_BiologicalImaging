"2D and 3D image visualization, segmentation, tracking in python!! (The promise of open source shareable tools like Napari makes me so excited I can't even tell you.) So specifically: bioimage input/output through jupyter notebooks; scikit-image packages and maybe starting some extensible workflows for common cell & dev bio problems?? Visualization in Napari (with dask); saving the movies with Napari movie or something like that; and finally working collaboratively!! I dunno version control, jupyterhub, colab, github, something so that we can start adding to each other's code, mixing and matching solutions in a truly open source and scriptable kind of way."

"Advanced imageJ (more on the scripting side) for biologists. It's been really frustrating to try to learn to code but also navigate the ImageJ infrastructure. An overview of image analysis packages/techniques for Python (for beginners). Basically more topics to bridge the gap between learning to code, and coding for image analysis. Sometimes I feel like it's either super basic or very advanced, and not much in the middle. ALSO: if you are scripting for ImageJ/Fiji in another language (not the macro language) how to set up your IDE!! I have seen a few quick github projects for this, but it's mostly over my head! "
"Ah, can I just please have all of the above? I like overviews (thinking about Neubias seminars that were recently hosted, Stardist was my favorite, even though my heart is with QuPath). How to do similar task in software A, B, C would be really fun - sometimes we are too invested in one soft and that is not always the best strategy. Data workflow management, simpler pipeline building for smaller projects to encourage more reproducible image analysis even when you have just a handful of images. How to spot problems with your image analysis and validate it. "
An overview of open source 4D analysis tools would I think be most useful because it is an area where there are no dominant players (outside say tracking) and so an overview would be more helpful in getting into the best of deeper cuts.
Analysis in 3D / python step-by-step tutorials
"Anything that gives me tools to apply and modify my own analysis. Nothing that is a black box, single use tool."
Application examples using a certain tool would be very useful.  
Applying specific tools to a user nominated data set
"As volumetric imaging increases, there is a need to easily visualize 3-D effects of a threshold on a provided data volume. Currently our toolsare constructed on a 2d world so this would be a major change in thinking. "
"Automating analysis, dealing with large data sets"
Basic computer science concepts (ie Boolean logic)
"Before learning how to use the software, understanding some basic principal of image analysis."
"Behind the scenes ImageJ/Fiji maintenance; OpenCV; side-by-side comparison of different open source analysis platforms to solve similar problems (to illustrate the strengths of each and to showcase utility - could maybe even be setup as a community challenge).... also, these suggestions are not very important to me, I'm just indicating 'off-the-cuff'"
"Benchmarking, and how to win over the skeptics who insist on counting cell manually for everything"
"Best practices, how to interpret antibody staining, how to distinguish between signal and noise"
Beyond the basics.
Building robust workflows. I'm biased to KNIME but I think good workflows are key.
Cell tracking
Cell tracking
"Cell tracking in 3D and data output (volume tracking and/or spot tracking, filtering parameters...); we will also benefit for a tool to easily create figures for papers (when you want to zoom in and represent the original image + the ROI of the zoom in + both scale bars + for multiple channels....), also standardized protocoles for basic image analysis (going from controls to PSF, etc...)"
Cell/molecular topics are too specialized to be able to suggest anything

"Comparisons of RNAscope analysis between softwares, particularly comparing IMARIS to new, open source softwares"

"Due to my lack of experience, I'm not sure what exactly I'd like to see."

Just because I am image analyst does not mean that it is easy to follow someone who explains in computer language something on a U-net setup. I had this experience in the last I2K conference in Heidelberg and I was a little disappointed. It seemed to have transformed into a meeting for only machine learning geeks.

How to use tools
I am most interested in developments that would work with super-resolution images
I like a lot the spot detection of ICY but other features of icy are poorly documented and it is hard to figure out what they do
"I like more general overviews of how a tool is meant to be used and how it ""thinks"" about an image/problem. I find seminars that go too deep into specific applications to be not that informative because every application is different. "
I recently discovered ICY and I am amazed by it. I think especially for beginners or people how don't want to dig deep into Image Analysis Fiji can be overwhelming and off putting. ICY seems to be a very good alternative there
I think comparisons between eg top 5 common softwares for specific tasks would be beneficial (eg. nucleus segmentation - FIJI/CellProfiler/Imaris/Amira/etc; Co-locolisiation - Imaris/CellProfiler/Fiji/Etc/).
I think just training biologists with the basics is still where we are at.
"I think we should be prioritizing open source software tools in general (imageJ, python etc)"
I would definitely want to learn more about machine learning for image analysis

I would like to see more on best practices for multidimensional XYZT analyses
I would like to see/hear a discussion of how to report accuracy of commonly used tools such as the wide-variety of thresholding / segmentation methods
"I would love some guides which merge theory & practice. There are abundant resources for learning the mathematics underlying analysis techniques, but many fewer demonstrating real world analysis of these data. I would prefer examples that use programming vs GUI-based tools."
I would love to see more on rod-shaped or overlapping objects. This is where I've had most of my trouble.
"I would really like to see a presentation of Icy vs CellProfiler vs FIJI done by experts in/advocates of each of those applications, where we can get a strong idea of what makes each of them really useful, and for what problems."
I'm new so I'm not sure but I think best practices and limits of what software can do would be good.

Many of the techniques discussed on the image analysis side are suitable for field-of-view images, or cell-based images and quickly run into trouble with the large histology slide files, particularly in terms of batch analysis. Conversations about how to quantitatively analyze these images quickly break down if neither side understands the language the other is speaking or the downstream needs of the user."
