"Two general challenges: (1) data volume - analyzing very large amounts of data, such as serial section EM data from large specimens at a sufficiently high resolution to identify small or closely spaced targets such as synaptic components; and (2) multiplexing, especially at the EM level - differentiating, locating, and representing data for more than two or three targets simultaneously. "

As a research pathologist working on large studies with many histology slides, I would like to be able to easily visually check accuracy of my algorithms and easily submit batch analysis of these files."
